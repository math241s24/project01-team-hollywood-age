# Proposal

Hollywood Age GapÂ 

Dataset description: The data was compiled by Lynn Fisher, a web designer. The dataset lists movies featuring romantic couples as observations, and their respective release years, actor names, birthdates, age gaps, and genders.

Dimensions: \[1\] 1177 12

Why we chose it: We chose this dataset because we were intrigued by the cultural representation of romantic relationships in cinema and how they create social norms and dynamics particularly in regards to gendered expectations.

Questions: Are men typically the older person in the age gap, and has this changed over time?

Are certain directors more likely to have larger age gaps in their films than others?\

Our plan :

Create a variable for average mean age gap between actors for each director

Create a visualization contrasting age gaps in different movies by gender over time

Create a visualization showing average age gap for each director with several movies on the list
