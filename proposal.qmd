Hollywood Age GapÂ 

Dataset description: The data was compiled by Lynn Fisher, a web designer. The dataset lists movies featuring romantic couples as observations, and their respective release years, actor names, birthdates, age gaps, and genders.

Dimensions: \[1\] 1177 12

Why we chose it: We chose this dataset because we were intrigued by the cultural representation of romantic relationships in cinema and how they create social norms and dynamics particularly in regards to gendered expectations.

Questions: Are men typically the older person in the age gap, and has this changed over time?

Are certain directors more likely to have larger age gaps in their films than others?\

Our plan :

Create a variable for average mean age gap between actors for each director; we can facet or color by director to achieve this. Since there are >500 directors, we will select the ten with the most movies in the dataset (Woody Allen, John Glen, Martin Scorsese, Mike Newell, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, Dennis Dugan, Guy Hamilton, and Mike Nichols). These directors are household names and will likely be of interest to our audience. To indicate that a director is an outlier, we can make a box plot and find summary statistics, and then find the directors that are outliers to our expectations.
